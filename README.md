## Loggy Discord Bot
To start the bot you need to go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Copy the files and run the main.py file, you need also to put your bot token into the .env file, discord.py is not a beginner friendly library, I suggest you to have at least basic Python knowledge.
* Invite your bot in your server with this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your_id_here&scope=bot&permissions=8
* Replace the **your_id_here** with your application ID.
* After you did that, you need to install all the required packages!

Install all the requirements with this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Ofc you need Python too, https://python.org

## How to setup .env file
in this .env file paste your token in it and it automatically will be changed 
Remember: Never give your token to anyone, they can do bad things with it! Treat it like a important password!
The .env is here for you to secure your token

## Issues, Questions or else

* I don't know if I even finished this bot 
* If there are some errors, idc fix them yourself
